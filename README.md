# smartMirror

I had seen these on the internet and thought it would be cool and fun to make one, so I did. 

This is a redo of one I have done previously in Ruby on Rails. This version has fancier, moving weather icons, a hand-written calendar, daily quote, and some imporved/simplified javascript. 
This verison was also written in Python using the Django web framework.
